        <p>Prep time: approx. 1 hour.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Russet potatoes, sliced</li>
            <li>1 yellow cooking onion, sliced</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>After peeling the potato and onion, slice each into equal sized slivers</li>
            <li>In a medium sauce pan or skillet, add olive oil and then add the sliced potato and onion, season with salt</li>
            <li>Cook potato and onion until they are slightly translucent, and are becoming soft to the touch</li>
            <li>Remove potato and onion from the heat, and pour the mixture into a large bowl</li>
            <li>Crack and beat the 4 eggs in a small bowl</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, when the potato and onion mixture has cooled down some, pour in the raw scrambled eggs and mix everything together</li>
            <li>Once mixed in the large bowl, let everything sit, covered, for about 30 minutes. This will help the flavours meld.</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, start by heating a frying pan and add 2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
            <li>When oil has heated, add egg mixture to the pan and let it cook</li>
            <li>After some minutes, when the eggs have cooked on one side, use a plate to carefully flip the tortilla on to the opposite side, so that you can fry the top</li>
            <li>Once both sides have been cooked, the tortilla is ready to be plated and served</li>
        </ol>
